# A Fun Halloween Costume Project!

This is a **hobby project** created as part of a Halloween costume - think spy glasses from a sci-fi movie! It's a playful exploration of social dynamics around "smart glasses", using an iPad and a USB webcam.

**Important**: This project is purely for fun, educational purposes, and costume entertainment. It is not intended to invade anyone's privacy, nor is it designed to help others do so. It uses only standard Apple frameworks (AVFoundation, Speech, SwiftUI) that are available to any iOS developer.

## What It Does

The app turns your iPad into a display for "smart glasses" by:
- Showing a live camera feed from an external USB webcam (or built-in camera)
- Providing real-time speech-to-text transcription of conversations
- Using a sleek glass-effect UI that looks futuristic

Perfect for Halloween parties, tech demos, or just having fun!

## Features

- **External Webcam Support**: Connect a USB webcam
- **Real-time Speech Recognition**: Live transcription using Apple's Speech framework
- **Multi-Camera Switching**: Easily switch between different cameras
- **Modern Glass UI**: Translucent interface elements using iOS glass effects
